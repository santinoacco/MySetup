[DONE] Add multiple batches training.
[DONE] Test multiple batches training.
    > **NOTE: it works with TFv2
[DEPRECATED] Check matrix building conditions.
[] Understand why background of data is different form MC background.
[DONE] Use MC photons as signal for training.
[DONE] Run Mohamed's code successfully
[DONE] Merge my code with Mohamed's
    > [ONGOING] Add documentation
    > [DONE] Add requirements.txt
    > [DONE] Test L2 training with Mohamed Framework
    > [DONE] Add HLT selection to photons (CutBased L2),
         in analogy to tight.
    > [DONE] Add validation / analysis,
    all results stored in `root` and `npy`,format:
        > [DONE] Apply L2 selection to events
        > [DONE] compute Signal Eff, Bkg reject
        > [DONE] compute roc curves.
        > [DONE] divide analysis in eta and pT.
        > [DONE] Fix the AUC matrix. Bin 4 should be empty cause its the crackbin.
        > [DONE] add uncertainties to ROC curves.
[] Generate MC samples of GammaJet and DiJet (JF) 17, 35, 70
[] Add training in Barrel and EndCup.
[] Add Full EtaRange training.
[DONE] Output model to ONNX framework
[] Add clusters (cells container) from EMcalo layer2 HLT,
   to ZllyAthDerivation.
[] Add HLT selection to photons (CutBased L2) in ZllyAthDerivation,
