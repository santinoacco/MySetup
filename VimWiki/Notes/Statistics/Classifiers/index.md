# Classifiers

Maps vectors of features in $R^d \rightarrow S_c$ to a space of classes or categories,
this space is divided by what we can call a *decision* boundary.
Actually the Image space is a set of a space of probabilities, that is:
$R^d \rightarrow P_c$, where $c$ are the classes.

## Linear

Linear clasifiers are those that define the decision boundary using a linear function,
its geometry depends on the dimensions,
thus in general it will be an hyperplane.
