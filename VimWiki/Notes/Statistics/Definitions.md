# Statistics definitions


### Probability Space
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space

### Precision
    - how many selected items are relevant?
    - can be seen as measure of quality.
    - related to Type-I error
    - a perfect precision score means that every result retrieve is relevant.

### Recall or Signal Efficiency or Sensitivity
    - a perfect recall score means that all relevant results where retrieve.


### Variance
 symbol: $$V{.}$$ or $$\sigma^2$$ 
 
 $$ V\{h(X)\} = E{[h(X) - E{h(X)}]^2} $$

### Sesgo
    - ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness
    - symbol: $\gamma$
    - meaning: is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
    
### Covariance
    - symbol: $cov(.)$ or $C(.)$

### Correlation coeficient
    - symbol: $\rho(.)$
    - if $|\rho(X,Y)|=1$ then X and Y are LINEALY DEPENDENT.
    - if $\rho(X,Y) = 0$ then X and Y are not LINEALY DEPENDENT, but they could still be NON LINEALY DEPENDENT or not.. it does not tell.

### Statistic
    -   Any quantity computed from the sample
