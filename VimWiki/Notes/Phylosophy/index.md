# my context

These paragraphs account as a warning and a welcome,
my thoughts are of course mine, don't mind the redundancy here...
However, as it will be seen shortly,
it is important if not fundamental to explicitly state what the system of reference is.
In order to do that I will state my principles,
the whole document should be coherent with these,
and in addition some personal ocntext (if relevant) should be provided.
My thought here is that in the future,
either me or someone else can come back to these sentences for reference.

So my values can be order as follow:
1. Family
2. Faith
3. Coherence
4. Life

# El paradigma de los contratos (The contracts paradigm)

What defines us as humans? well it's cetainly not only one thing,
we can probably cut it to a few key characteristics such as:
- speech
- self-conciousness
- freedom
- interests

We could probably come with individual examples of entities that hold some of these characteristics but,
I can't think of any other being sharring those qualities and not being recognised as a human being.
More on this later, probably...

The first three characteristics mentioned before are probalby the less argueable,
however the reader might find the last one a bit confusing.
How interests, being completely subjective could define an objective classification of a being?
Well indeed, us humans are very social beings, and this quality is nowadays a distinct one of us.
One may argue that there are plenty social animals,
and that is indeed true, then again none of which share all four characteristics described above,
but we have certainly taken social behaviour to another level.
It has become our most useful, reliable and extended tool,
one that enabled us to conquest not only our environment (up to a certain level) but also the rate of our responses to it.
So that thing that glues our societies are most certainly at the heart of what defines us.
Now you are probably wondering what is that thing..?
Well it is the tension/dicotomy between individual interests and plural contracts (or agreements).

I here you there, are individual interests selfish?
technically yes, but not in a "bad" way, meaning not in an inmoral ground.
Though they are intrinsically subjective.
That is a very important statement since it is one of the purelly subjective concepts we can think of,
alongside dreams, beliefs, body-soul.
Thus they define in a recurrent and consistent way the meaning of "subjectivity".
Lets formalize it a little bit further:
- "subjectivity": is the collection of unique characteristics that can define and distinguish an individual.
Therefore, no two individuals share the same interests, dreams, beliefs or body-souls.
You may wonder, could this collection be bigger?... maybe, idk, those are the ones I could think of.
We can also refer to "subjectivity" as the expression/projection of an individual,
but such definition only makes sence once we have defined an individual;
which is exactly what we did by defining "subjectivity".

So now we can go further and realise that dreams, beliefs and interests are not independent,
so one could choose one of them to describe the others,
for the porpose of this thesis I chose "interest",
so that we can later contrast with the contracts.
In this context beliefs include principles and values,
and interests are synonims of dessires/wishes.

A very interesting questions would be to ask whether interests are afected by our environment,
in which case they wouldn't be completely subjective.
The thing is that if we state that we (humans) ARE social beings,
society must also play a role at what defines us.
But we have accounted for this previously when mentioning the interests-contracts-social-dicotomy,
as we will detail later,
it is a recursive mechanism that has to be understood dynamically.
So we will think of "interests" as the "drive",
that could have different natures: chemical, physical, environmental, etc.
But in any case they condence a unique expression of an individual.
I haven't answered the previous question though,
beliefs create dreams which will fire up interests,
that reinforce or discard previous beliefs,
and so on.

So again, we could use different words, but the essence is that us beings have a "drive" which is unique and therefore characteristic of our individuality.

Okay, so if we are driven individually how come a collective behaviour emmerges?
Logic states that given a number of individuals that behave randomly (only driven by their interest)
will show caothic motion,
meaning no collective behaviour.
So in order for a collective order to emerge, an underling mechanism of interactions must exist,
whichs nature a priori we don't undertand.
Actually there is probably many different mechanism with different nature,
given an specific environment or context.
But the essence of all of those social interactions remains in the tension between contracts and intrests.

At some point we realized that posponning the fullfillment of some of our interests in exchange of a greater common interest was worth it.
This was the birth of the contracts between individuals.
Since two individuals have a priori different interest,
a contract must explicitly or implicitly (by assumption for instance) acknowledge those interests.
A contract then consists of an agreement or understanding between two or more individuals,
that contrains their dynamic and/or behaviour.
Lets put it in a simple example:
John and Matt are both hungry and there is one banana left. 
In this situation there is an environment external context which is the fact that there is only one banana,
and there are two oposed interest being,
that John is hungry and wants to eat the banana,
and Mat is also hungry and also wants to eat the banana.
Just to clarify these are opposed interest because John wants to eat the banana HIMSELF,
and doesn't want Matt to eat it.
If both John and Matt wanted John to eat the banana then they would share the same interest.
So if they agree to share the banana then their behaviour is constrained to their agreement,
they can't eat the whole fruit and they are bound to not fullfil their hunger.
